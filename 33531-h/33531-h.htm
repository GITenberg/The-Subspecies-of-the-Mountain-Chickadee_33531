<h1>THE SUBSPECIES OF THE

MOUNTAIN CHICKADEE</h1>

<h4>BY</h4>

<h3>JOSEPH GRINNELL</h3>

<h4>(Contribution From the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California)</h4>
<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Fieldwork was carried on by the California Museum of Vertebrate
Zoology during 1917 in the Inyo region of eastern California. In
going over the collection of birds obtained, the attention of the writer
was arrested by certain peculiarities evident in the Mountain Chickadees.
Comparison with series from the Sierras showed the Inyo birds
to be paler colored and longer tailed; and in order to appraise these
differences in taxonomic terms it became necessary to assemble material
representative of the entire range of the species, in so far as
possible. The results of the study thus undertaken are presented
herewith.</p>

<p>The material involved in the inquiry has amounted to 464 skins
of the Mountain Chickadee, derived from the following sources other
than the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology: United States National
Museum, through Dr. Charles W. Richmond; United States Biological
Survey, through Mr. Edward W. Nelson; and the private collections
of Messrs. Edward R. Warren, Joseph and John W. Mailliard,
G. Frean Morcom, Harry S. Swarth, and J. Grinnell.</p>

<p>As of general interest, and in the nature of an introduction to the
systematic analysis to follow, it may be stated that <i>Penthestes gambeli</i>
including its subspecies is throughout its range non-migratory, save
as a few individuals in pairs or small companies occasionally descend
in fall or early winter to lower levels closely adjacent to their mountain
habitats. The range of the species roughly extends from and
includes the Rocky Mountains to or nearly to the Pacific Coast, and
from Alberta and British Columbia south nearly to the Mexican line--somewhat
south of it in northern Lower California. Within this general
area the Mountain Chickadee is by no means uniformly distributed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
Especially towards the south is its range very "spotty," the
representations on detached mountain tops being wholly isolated.
Two main areas of relatively continuous distribution are, however,
perceivable--the Rocky Mountain area, and the Sierra Nevada area.</p>

</div>

<p>Close scrutiny of the series of specimens at hand well representing
the entire Rocky Mountain area reveals no variation in phylogenetic
characters from the northernmost to the southernmost stations. All
show in apparently equal degree the long tail and cinnamon tinge of
sides and back, these features together constituting the grounds for
separate subspecific recognition of a Rocky Mountain form. On the
other hand, the Sierra Nevadan center, with its own recognizable race,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
of relatively short tail, proves to have two outlying divergent forms.
These three forms are alike in their lack of any cinnamon tinge, this
being replaced in two of them by a buffy tinge and in one form by
leaden gray. The tail in one of the outlying forms is long, in the
other short. The habitats concerned are, respectively, the desert
mountains of the Inyo region of eastern California, and the coastal
mountains of southern California. This differentiation within the
Pacific district, particularly within the state of California, will be
better understood in its geographic bearing by reference to the accompanying
map (fig. 1).</p>

<p>The behavior of the tail of <i>Penthestes gambeli</i>--long in the Rocky
Mountain district, short in the Pacific district (see figs. 2, 3)--is paralleled
in the <i>Penthestes atricapillus</i> group of chickadees across the
North American continent in about the latitude of the state of Washington.
In the northern Rocky Mountains occurs the race <i>P. a. septentrionalis</i>,
with long tail; in the Pacific Coast strip of Washington
and Oregon occurs the race <i>P. a. occidentalis</i>, with, among other characters,
relatively short tail. Other parallels are to be found in the
genera <i>Psaltriparus</i>, <i>Thryomanes</i> and <i>Pipilo</i>.</p>

<p>It is improbable that the fact of subspecific differentiation in
<i>Penthestes gambeli</i> has been altogether overlooked previous to the
present time. A premonition of the geographic variation now formally
pointed out is to be found in the early writings of Baird (1858,
p. 394), who remarked that "a specimen, apparently of this species
[<i>Parus montanus</i>], from Medicine Bow creek [Wyoming], (5643,)
though marked female, is larger than those from California, as shown
by the measurements." Also, some of the differences in proportions
in the subspecies now recognized are shown in the table of measurements
given by Ridgway (1904, p. 409).</p>

<p>For a detailed description of the Mountain Chickadee as a <i>species</i>,
the reader is referred to Ridgway (1904, p. 408).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>--Santa Fé, New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--Among the four subspecies of <i>Penthestes gambeli</i> here
recognized, color alone is sufficient for distinguishing <i>P. gambeli gambeli</i>.
The flanks, sides of body and back in this form are pervaded
with a distinct tinge of cinnamon--more exactly, the "pinkish buff"
of Ridgway (1912, pl. 29). In addition, this race shows the greatest
length of tail, and slenderest bill.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>--Average of 14 males: Wing, 70.5 mm.; tail, 70.2;
exposed culmen, 8.6; depth of bill at base, 3.8. For extremes, see
accompanying table.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Note.</i>--In this paper the length of wing is the usual chord of the folded wing
as dried at the side of the body in the conventional study skin. The tail length,
however, is measured from the <i>base</i> of the uropygium to the tip of the longest
pair of rectrices. It is found that in preparing specimens there is a practically
uniform place for cutting off from the body the uropygium with attached
feathers, and this is exactly where the tail bends back at an angle to the body in
the fresh bird. The lateral rectrices are rooted evenly with the base of the dried
uropygium so that the measurement of tail length thus taken becomes the distance
from the extreme proximal ends of the most lateral pair of rectrices to the tips
of the central pair--somewhat greater than the length of tail as given by Ridgway
(1901, p. xv), the latter being the measurement from the base of the central pair
of tail feathers to the tips of same. My reason for adopting this different procedure
here is that more accuracy seems possible thereby, at least in the kind of
material here dealt with. There is less mussing of the specimen also.</p>
</div>

<p>Neither depth of bill nor culmen is a practical index to degree of
slenderness of bill. No ordinary method of measurement will suffice
to indicate the facts as they are perceived by the eye.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the dates in the tables, as a rule only unworn
specimens have been selected for measurement.</p>

<i>Type</i>, male adult, no. 28782, Mus. Vert. Zool.; October 7, 1917;
collected by J. Grinnell, orig. no. 4588.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>--The palest colored race of the four; sides, flanks and
back, in unworn plumage, pervaded with pale buff--the "cartridge
buff" of Ridgway (1912, pl. 30). Wear or fading, or both, removes
most of this buff tone, so that the resulting effect, in spring and summer
birds, is of an ashy tone of coloration, distinctly lighter than in
any of the other three subspecies, in same stage. It seems probable
that there is a paler tone to the underlying plumage parts and that
this becomes revealed by loss of the superficial pigment-bearing portions
through the gradual progress of feather abrasion. <i>Inyoensis</i>
shows nearly as long a tail as does <i>gambeli</i>. Its bill is somewhat
smaller.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>

<p><i>General remarks.</i>--In making use of the intrinsic color characters,
which are important here in distinguishing subspecies, it is, of course,
essential that the effects of extraneous factors be taken into account.
Prolonged wear and fading evidently serve to weaken the intensity of
the color tones, more especially the buffy ones. Then, too, chickadees
seem peculiarly susceptible to discoloration by smoke, soot and charred
wood; for example, our series from Cisco and Blue Cañon, stations
along the Central Pacific Railway over the Sierra Nevada, even though
taken in September and October almost immediately after completion
of the fall molt, are obviously more or less begrimed with soot. On
the other hand, the autumn- and winter-taken series from the Yosemite
region and from the Siskiyou Mountains are clean, and show their
intrinsic color tones to good advantage.</p>

<p>Intergradation undoubtedly connects the four races of the Mountain
Chickadee into a continuous series of forms. Abundant material
at hand from that portion of the Sierra Nevada immediately south of
Mount Whitney shows complete transition from <i>Penthestes gambeli
baileyae</i> to <i>P. g. abbreviatus</i>; in fact, many of the specimens can only
be placed arbitrarily in one category or the other. Several examples
from the vicinity of Mono Lake, in Mono County, California, and
from along the west flank of the Sierras in Inyo County, insensibly
bridge the interval between <i>P. g. abbreviatus</i> and <i>P. g. inyoensis</i>, especially
when considered in connection with the individual variation to
which each race is subject in about normal degree.</p>

<p>Material at hand from different parts of the Great Basin is unsatisfactory
either in that it is scanty or because of the worn state of the
plumage. A summer-taken series of 13 Mountain Chickadees (nos.
8952-8964, Mus. Vert. Zool.) from the Pine Forest Mountains, Humboldt
County, Nevada, shows in color no approach to <i>P. gambeli gambeli</i>.
In this respect it is like <i>P. g. inyoensis</i>, but the tail averages
nearly as short as in <i>P. g. abbreviatus</i>. Taking all features into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
account it seems best placed under <i>abbreviatus</i>. Fresh-plumaged fall
specimens from this locality would make determination more certain.</p>

<p>A specimen (&#9794;, no. 547, Mus. Vert. Zool.) from Anthony, Baker
County, Oregon, taken October 16, 1907, might be referred to <i>P. g.
abbreviatus</i>; but the tone of color of back and sides is much darker
than usual in that form. It is certainly much darker than in <i>P. g.
inyoensis</i>. Its tail is but 65.3 mm. long. A skin (&#9792;, no. 18, Morcom
coll.) from Camp Harney, Harney County, Oregon, February 17,
1875, has a tail length of 67.7 mm., and in depth of color is about
intermediate between <i>abbreviatus</i> and <i>P. g. gambeli</i>. A specimen
(&#9792;, no. 136639, U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. coll.) from Fort Spokane,
Lincoln County, Washington, September 28, 1890, is almost identical
with <i>gambeli</i> in coloration; but it, too, has a short tail, only 64.4 mm.
long, though there is chance of error here, as several of the rectrices
are missing. The writer prefers to leave these last three examples for
the time being unplaced.</p>

<p>It is clear that intergradation between <i>Penthestes gambeli gambeli</i>
and any one of the other three subspecies is less well established than
between any two of these other three. But sufficiency of material from
the proper localities through eastern Oregon and eastern Washington
would likely prove its existence as is the case between the California
forms.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
